# What is it ?

[FreeScanner](https://github.com/amigan/freescanner) is a *completely free and open source* software that ingest and distribute audio files generated by various software-defined radio recorders. Its interface tries to reproduce the user experience of a real police scanner, while adding its own touch. It is a fork of [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner), and most of the code is copyright Chrystian Huot.

You can listen to [FreeScanner](https://github.com/amigan/freescanner) on any modern browsers using the integrated web app.

# Recorders compatibility

# Why does this fork exist?

This is a good application, but forcing users to *subscribe* (not even have a perpetual license!) to have your native mobile app without annoying anti-features like ads
and forced key beeps, and nagging users when they use the webapp on mobile, and adding zero recurring value (which is what a subscription is for) is a bridge too far.

Open source should be unconditional. If you want to guilt-trip the hell out of your users (or potential contributors), that's on you, but maybe you'd be better served
by just having a proprietary license. Oh, I know, then you can't have the open source fuzzy feels, or appropriate work done by contributors. Oops.

Also, I have some ideas of my own that I would like to implement. I pledge that any work done on FreeScanner will always be 100% free, without exception.
