# IFRAME example

It may be useful for some installations to have a section with information or instructions so that users can read and better understand what it is about.

Here is an example of a web page that embeds an FreeScanner instance in an `<iframe ...>` with responsive content.

You can use these files as a starter kit and update them as you wish.

> Remember to replace the `<iframe src="http://localhost:3000">` value with the address of your FreeScanner instance.
